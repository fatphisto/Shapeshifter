# Shapeshifter
Shapeshifter is a collection of ~~forbidden spells~~ bookmarklets that transform humans into other entities.

## Spells
### Bearify
Inspired by [@A_single_bear](http://twitter.com/A_single_bear), this spell turns humans into bears.

## Installation
Save the scripts into bookmarks and start using them. I'll make this easier when I will redesign my website.

## Contibution
You are free to fork this project and make your own set of spells, but if you have a particularly witty one in mind that you think would fit well in this grimoire go ahead and create a pull request.
