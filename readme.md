# Shapeshifter
Shapeshifter is a collection of ~~forbidden spells~~ bookmarklets that transform humans into other entities.

## Spells
### Bearify
Inspired by [@A_single_bear](http://twitter.com/A_single_bear), this spell turns humans into bears. Sometimes I wish I was a bear.

### Humanize
After reading [Julie Zhuo](http://www.juliezhuo.com/)'s article "[The Death of “Users” and “Product Design”](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-death-of-users-and-product-design-a857f1ad2f3b)" I was skeptical of the suggested approach, but still open to give it a try. I've done that quite literally for the sole purpose of having fun.
Take it for a ride, hilarious things might happen.

## Installation
Save the scripts into bookmarks and start using them. I'll make this easier when I will redesign my website.

## Contibution
You are free to fork this project and make your own set of spells, but if you have a particularly witty one in mind that you think would fit well in this grimoire go ahead and create a pull request.
